"""Unit tests for data loading, preprocessing, and feature engineering.

This module contains test cases for the data processing pipeline of the HDB resale
price prediction project. It verifies that all data loading, cleaning, preprocessing,
and feature engineering steps work correctly and consistently.

The tests use small samples of real data when available or create appropriate synthetic
data when needed. Tests are designed to verify that:
1. Data can be loaded correctly from files
2. Data paths are resolved correctly
3. Preprocessing removes or handles missing values and outliers
4. Feature engineering creates expected new features
5. All data transformations preserve data integrity

These tests ensure that changes to the data pipeline don't introduce regressions
and that the pipeline components work correctly in isolation and together.

Typical test run:
    $ python -m unittest tests.test_data
