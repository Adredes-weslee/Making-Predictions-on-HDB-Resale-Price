"""Unit tests for the Streamlit application components.

This module contains test cases for the various components of the HDB resale price
prediction Streamlit application. It uses unittest and mocking to test UI components
without requiring an actual Streamlit server or browser.

The tests verify that:
1. The sidebar navigation functions correctly
2. Visualization components render the expected plots and metrics
3. UI elements respond appropriately to different inputs

These tests ensure that user interface components work as expected independently
of the data processing and model prediction code, allowing for isolated testing
of the application's presentation layer.

Typical test run:
    $ python -m unittest tests.test_app
